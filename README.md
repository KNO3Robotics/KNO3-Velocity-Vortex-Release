This is the code that ran on KNO3's (FTC 7203) robot, Tyche, at the Houston Championships in 2017.
Some of the autonomous code has been removed from the repo, and so it may not compile.
However, in the interest of making the structure of the codebase available for teams to observe, we have released it.
Feel free to ask questions about anything though!
